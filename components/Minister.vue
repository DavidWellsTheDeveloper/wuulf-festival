                Our WUULF minister for 2022 will be Rev. Teri. She will be 
                leading us in "in gathering" each morning at WUULF. In gathering 
                is much like a typical Unitarian service, however it is always kid
                friendly, and typically held outdoors under the big tree near the 
                lower pavilion.

                This year, in addition to Teri, Dee Masters (Teri's partner) 
                will be leading us in a variety of improv workshops. For those of you 
                who don't know Dee, he's led WUULF attendees in years past 
                in improv, and it was an enormous hit. We are extremely 
                excited to have him back again.
