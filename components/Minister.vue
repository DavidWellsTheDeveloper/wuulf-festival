                We've heard your feedback, and have decided to bring back a dedicated minister 
                for 2023. If you know a minister who would love the WUULF community, and would 
                us in contact with them, feel free to email the WUULF board at 
                <a href="mailto: wuulf@groups.io">wuulf@groups.io</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                WUULF 2023 will be having our "in 
                gathering" worships every morning following breakfast. For more details see the schedule.
