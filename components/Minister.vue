                WUULF will not have a dedicated community minister this year. At it's 
                core, WUULF is about the community we are building and growing after 
                being apart for so long. Part of our theme "Back To Our Roots" is 
                about taking ownership of WUULF and making it our own once again. 
                We will draw on our community wisdom to help with ministry this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                WUULF 2022 will be having rotating community members leading our in 
                gathering worships every morning following breakfast.
            </p>
