It hurts their loved ones, their co-workers, and their workplaces. In this two-hour workshop, we will first identify the many forms of nuanced ageism. We then will review the laws intended to protect older Americans. Finally, we will cover strategies to counter these many forms of discrimination.'

Celebrate the changing of the season with a musical sunset solstice ritual with chants, drumming, dancing, and other sacred rhythms shared at Echo Amphitheater, a special place inside Mother Earth. All instruments welcome but remember that you need to carry your stuff up the hill and several flights of stairs! Brawny people will be recruited as necessary to help carry those unable to make the hike. Echo Amphitheater is about a ten-minute drive from Ghost Ranch. Remember to bring your flashlights, jackets and bug repellent.'
